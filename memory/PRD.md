# Sparsa Homeoclinic — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Internal clinic management for **Sparsa Homeoclinic** (homeopathy clinic, 5 PCs on LAN).
Workflow: **Reception → Doctor → Pharmacy → PRO/Billing**.
Roles: ADMIN, OWNER_DOCTOR (Jyothi — all cases), DOCTOR (Hemanth — own only), RECEPTION, PHARMACY, PRO.

## Stack
React + FastAPI + MongoDB (original spec was Laravel + MySQL).

## What's Implemented

### v1 (33 tests pass)
JWT auth · roles · patient UIDs · case workflow · clinical notes · versioned prescriptions · pharmacy dispense · billing · bilingual EN/Telugu receipt · on-screen reminders · per-case AI assist · admin (users/audit/stats).

### v2 (53 tests pass)
File attachments (Emergent Object Storage, 10MB jpg/png/pdf) · patient timeline · 5 CSV exports · Twilio + WhatsApp Cloud API (graceful PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED fallback + background scheduler) · mongodump backup/restore scripts.

### v3 (71 tests pass)
Refactored 1154-line server.py into modular routers (core.py + models.py + 10 routers + seed.py + 64-line server.py) · AI Visit Recap (5-line briefing from full patient history) · full step-by-step cron/Task Scheduler walkthrough in scripts/README.md.

### v4 (97 tests pass — current build, 2026-06-20)
- **Past Visit migration** — `POST /api/patients/{id}/past-visit` creates backdated CLOSED cases. UI form on patient timeline.
- **Google Docs paste import** — `POST /api/ai/parse-visit-notes` uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to extract structured visit data from free-form notes; pre-fills the past-visit form.
- **Billing closure UX** — green success card after PAID, with Print Receipt / Patient Timeline / Back to Queue actions; payment form goes read-only.
- **Branding cleanup** — browser title "Sparsa Homeoclinic", removed demo-creds block from login.
- **Admin user CRUD** — `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` (self-delete blocked, OWNER_DOCTOR soft-deactivated).
- **Patient edit/delete** — reception/owner can edit; reception can delete cases-free patients; admin can hard-delete with cascade (clinical_notes, prescriptions, pharmacy_dispense, payments, reminders, attachments soft-deleted).
- **Admin Analytics dashboard** — 30-day cases+revenue chart, logins-by-role, top complaints, average turnaround time.
- **Pharmacy Dashboard** — KPIs (pending dispense, today's dispensed count, medicine revenue today, active reminders) + reminders side panel.
- **PRO Dashboard** — today/total revenue, outstanding, pending bills, 7-day revenue trend chart, mode breakdown, follow-ups due today.
- **Pharmacy Reminders module** — doctor's followups with `notify_pharmacy=true` appear on pharmacy dashboard + dedicated `/pharmacy/reminders` page with PENDING/COMPLETED/SENT tabs and Mark Complete action.
- **Doctor Reminders enhanced** — tabs (PENDING/SENT/COMPLETED/FAILED), search, mark complete, snooze (datetime picker), send now, delete.
- **IST everywhere** — all reminder/timeline/dashboard times shown in Asia/Kolkata. New `fmtIST` + `istLocalToUtcISO` helpers; backend day-bounds calculated in IST.
- **PRO privacy fix** — clinician-written reminder notes hidden from PRO followups feed.
- ✅ 98/98 backend tests pass with iteration_5 fixes verified.

### v5 (121 tests pass — 2026-06-20)
- **Admin Messaging Settings page** (`/admin/messaging`) — DB-backed runtime Twilio + WhatsApp credentials, no restart required. Masked display, per-field Clear via `__CLEAR__` sentinel, 30s cache refresh in scheduler. Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/admin/messaging-settings`. Provider precedence: DB → env.
- **Admin Analytics → MongoDB aggregations** — replaced 30 sequential `count_documents`+`aggregate` calls with two bucketed aggregations using `$dateAdd` + `$dateToString` (IST). Top complaints now `$split`/`$unwind`/`$group` server-side. Turnaround now a single `$dateFromString` aggregation. <0.5s on current dataset.
- **File-upload size hardening** — `/api/cases/{id}/attachments` streams in 64 KB chunks, aborts at >10 MB without buffering full payload.
- ✅ iteration_6: 23/23 backend + 8/8 frontend tests pass.

### v6 (logo branding — 2026-06-20)
- **Sparsa Homeo Care logo** wired into the sidebar, login hero card + login header, and the printable receipt. Saved at `/app/frontend/public/logo.png`. Also wired as favicon + apple-touch-icon.
- Reusable `<Logo />` component (`/app/frontend/src/components/Logo.jsx`) as single source of truth.
- Brand text harmonised to "Sparsa Homeo Care" in receipts, browser title, page meta, and WhatsApp/SMS reminder body.

### v7 (Phase A — FIR + date-only follow-ups — iteration_7 ✅ 15/15)
- **Patient model expanded**: marital_status, height_cm, weight_kg, **auto-BMI**, consulting_doctor_id, sources (multi-select), referral_name, chief_complaint, visit_type.
- New endpoint `POST /api/patients/fir` creates patient + first case atomically.
- Reception **New Patient** page rewritten as comprehensive FIR form (sectioned UI, conditional referral-name, BMI live-calc, walk-in/appointment radio).
- **Follow-up changed to date-only**: `FollowupIn.next_followup_date: date`; anchored to 09:00 IST UTC for the scheduler. UI uses a `<input type="date">`.
- Test data wiped per user's request; counters reset.

### v8 (Phases B + C + D — iteration_8 ✅ 34/34 pytest)
- **Phase B — Patient search & quick contact**:
  - `GET /api/patients?search=…` now RBAC-scoped: non-owner DOCTOR only sees patients with cases assigned to them (uses `doctor_id`, not `user.id` — fixed).
  - New `/doctor/patients` page (search + tap-to-call/SMS/WhatsApp quick-actions). Reusable `<QuickContact />` exported.
  - Pharmacy + Doctor reminder cards and PRO follow-up widget now show phone number + QuickContact buttons.
- **Phase C — PRO power features**:
  - `GET /api/pro/financial-search?q=…` — global billing search; per-patient summary + per-visit table.
  - `POST /api/cases/{id}/attachments` now accepts `kind=PAYMENT_PROOF`. PRO can upload payment proofs (UPI/PhonePe/GPay screenshots) before closing a bill. `?kind=PAYMENT_PROOF` filter on list endpoint.
  - `GET /api/pro/analytics` — comprehensive business analytics (patient demographics, source acquisition, visits by doctor + type, 30-day revenue trend, mode breakdown, consult vs medicine split, operational turnaround, outstanding).
  - New `/pro/financial-search` and `/pro/analytics` pages with bar charts.
- **Phase D — Admin & AI**:
  - Inline **Reset password** modal on Admin → Users (per-user). Backend enforces `min_length=8` on `UserCreateIn`/`UserUpdateIn`.
  - AI Visit Recap now supports `?mode=detailed` (owner doctor / admin only) → Markdown response with 6 sections: Patient Profile, Clinical Assessment, Possible Diagnostic Directions, **Mother Tincture Suggestions**, Lifestyle Recommendations, Treatment Considerations + a "decision-support only" disclaimer. `mode=brief` (default) keeps the 5-line briefing.
  - Tiny inline Markdown renderer in the timeline UI (avoids new dependency).

### v9 (Workflow re-order + Reminder fixes + AI Master Prompt + IBM Plex font — iteration_9 ✅ 17/17 backend + 8/8 frontend)
- **Workflow re-ordered**: Reception → Doctor → **PRO → Pharmacy** → Completed (was D→Pharma→PRO).
  - New status `AWAITING_PRO_REVIEW` between consultation and billing.
  - Doctor's primary action: "Complete consultation · Send to PRO". Secondary: "Send direct to Pharmacy" — requires a bypass reason (audit-logged + `pharmacy_bypassed_pro=true` on case).
  - PRO recording `PAID + medicines_taken=true` auto-forwards case to `SENT_TO_PHARMACY`. Consultation-only (`medicines_taken=false`) → `CLOSED`. Explicit "Send to Pharmacy" button also available for partial/pending payments.
  - Pharmacy dispense now closes case (was forwarded to billing).
  - Status label "CLOSED" renamed → "Completed" everywhere in UI.
- **Reminder bugs fixed**:
  - Manual reminder creation now writes `patient_phone` + `scheduled_date`.
  - Snooze writes `scheduled_date` (consistent display).
  - **Pharmacy can snooze** (was complete-only).
  - **Audience filter** for OWNER_DOCTOR & ADMIN: All / Mine / Pharmacy tabs on /doctor/reminders.
- **AI Master Prompt** (`?mode=detailed`): 11 sections — Executive Summary · Clinical Assessment · Homeopathic Analysis · Remedy Suggestions · Mother Tincture · Patient Advice · Prescription Instructions · Follow-up · Lifestyle · **Confidence (Low/Medium/High)** · **Missing Information** + ⚠️ Disclaimer. Pulls full demographics, BMI, allergies, history, prescriptions.
- **Font upgrade**: IBM Plex Sans (body) + IBM Plex Serif (headings) + IBM Plex Mono (numbers/code) — enterprise-credible, calm, used in healthcare/finance.
- Tests: `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration9.py` 17/17 pass.

## Bring-your-own-key for AI (DONE 2026-07-06)
Admin → sidebar → **AI Settings** (`/admin/ai`):
- Paste own API key for **Anthropic Claude / OpenAI GPT / Google Gemini** (stored masked in `db.settings _id:"ai"`).
- Pick active **provider + model** (dependent dropdowns, validated server-side against `ai_settings.MODELS`).
- **Test key** button per provider (`POST /api/admin/ai-settings/test`) fires a tiny prompt, returns ok/error.
- Runtime behavior (`routers/ai.py::_call_llm` → `ai_settings.resolve_ai_config`): own key used when set; if the call fails (invalid/expired key) it auto-retries once with the built-in Emergent Universal Key — AI never breaks.
- Endpoints: GET/POST `/api/admin/ai-settings`, POST `/api/admin/ai-settings/test` (ADMIN only, audited).
- Tests: `/app/backend/tests/test_ai_settings.py` 7/7 pass. Verified fallback in logs (fake key → Emergent key → valid draft).
- ⚠️ Note (2026-07-06): Emergent Universal Key budget was near-exhausted during testing (Budget exceeded 0.408/0.4) — user should top up via Profile → Universal Key → Add Balance, or add own provider keys.

## Elegant Login + Mobile Polish + Homeopathic Clinical Decision Support (DONE 2026-07-20)
- **Login page redesign**: full-bleed clinic reception image background with gradient overlay, centered glassmorphism card, larger 96px logo. `/app/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`.
- **Mobile / tablet responsive shell** (P2 done): Sheet-based drawer sidebar on <lg, sticky mobile top bar with hamburger + logo + role, larger touch targets (nav-links min 44px, inputs 16px font to prevent iOS zoom, buttons min 44px). `/app/frontend/src/components/AppLayout.jsx`, `/app/frontend/src/index.css`.
- **Responsive page pass**: all `p-8` pages now `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8`, headings scale `text-2xl sm:text-3xl`, KPI grids collapse to 1/2 cols, wide tables wrap in `.table-scroll`, page headers stack on mobile.
- **Stacked, tab-based Case Detail** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/doctor/CaseDetail.jsx`): tabs now icon+label, horizontally scrollable strip; header block stacks vertically on tablet/mobile; prescription grid switches to stacked layout on <sm; action buttons wrap and are 40-44px tall.
- **Homeopathic Clinical Decision Support (AI Assist)** — new hero action on the AI tab:
  - Backend: `POST /api/cases/{case_id}/ai/decision_support` (added to `routers/ai.py`). Assembles a full clinical dossier (patient profile + all past visits/notes/prescriptions + current case + attachment metadata) via new `_build_clinical_dossier()` helper and calls a homeopathy-specialist system prompt (`prompts.case_decision_support()`).
  - Prompt expertise: materia medica (Boericke/Kent/Allen/Phatak/Clarke/Vermeulen), repertorization (Kent's/Boger/Synthesis), mother tinctures & Q potencies, German methodologies (Reckeweg/Schuessler biochemic/Heel), miasmatic analysis, evidence-informed homeopathy.
  - Output: 13-section Markdown advisory (Case Snapshot → Clinical Reasoning → Differentials → Homeopathic Analysis with rubrics → Suggested Remedies → Mother Tinctures → German/Biochemic → Rx draft → Patient Advice → Follow-up → Red Flags → Evidence Notes → Confidence + gaps → Disclaimer). Rendered via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` with themed styling.
  - RBAC preserved: only OWNER_DOCTOR + DOCTOR (with case-ownership check via `load_case_for_user`). Audited as `AI_USED action=decision_support`.
  - Tests: `/app/backend/tests/test_ai_decision_support.py` 14/14 pass (iteration_10). RBAC + regression on existing summarize/advice/instructions actions verified.
- Existing quick actions (summarize / advice / instructions) retained as secondary compact buttons under the hero card.



## How to enable WhatsApp + SMS reminders
**Option A (preferred):** Log in as ADMIN → sidebar → **Messaging** → paste keys → Save. Live immediately, no restart.
**Option B:** Add to `/app/backend/.env` and restart backend:
```
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=...
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_FROM=+1...
```

## "Made with Emergent" badge
Per Emergent support: appears only in the preview environment. Auto-removed on deployment / paid plans.

## Backlog
### P1
- ~~BYOK admin UI for AI provider~~ (DONE 2026-07-06 — see "Bring-your-own-key" section).
- N+1 query optimization in `list_cases` (`routers/cases.py`) — batch fetch via `$in` (deployment agent warning).
- Async HTTP for messaging.py (replace `requests` with `httpx.AsyncClient`).
- Streaming CSV cursor for very large exports.
- Allow RECEPTION to create call-back reminders (if needed).

### P2
- N+1 query optimization (use `$lookup` aggregation in patient timeline + dashboards).
- Configurable reminder templates in admin UI.
- Richer top_complaints (medical term filter / TF-IDF).
- Brute-force lockout on `/api/auth/login`.
- ~~**Mobile / tablet responsive pass**~~ (DONE 2026-07-20 — drawer sidebar, responsive padding, stacked case detail, larger touch targets).

## Next Action Items
- Replace `/app/frontend/public/logo.png` with a higher-res / SVG version anytime — the `<Logo />` component already loads from `/logo.png`.
- Paste Twilio + WhatsApp keys via **/admin/messaging** (or backend/.env) to activate WhatsApp/SMS.
- Schedule `/app/scripts/backup.sh` on the clinic server PC (cron / Task Scheduler) — see `/app/scripts/README.md`.
